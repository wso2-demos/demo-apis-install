# WSO2 API Manager - Environment to APIM Version Mapping
# This configuration file maps environment names to their respective apictl command versions
#
# Format: Each mapping is defined as:
#   env_<environment_name>="apictl_command"
#
# Available apictl commands:
#   - apictl45: For WSO2 APIM 4.5.x environments
#   - apictl46: For WSO2 APIM 4.6.x environments
#
# Usage:
#   Both backup.sh and import.sh scripts automatically source this file
#   and use the appropriate apictl version based on the environment name.
#
# Example:
#   If you're exporting from "dev" environment mapped to apictl45,
#   the script will use apictl45 for all operations.
#
# To add a new environment:
#   Simply add a new line following the pattern below:
#   env_your_env_name="apictl45"  # or apictl46
#
# Note: This format is compatible with Bash 3.2+ (macOS default)

# Development environments
env_dev="apictl45"
env_snapshot="apictl46"
env_rc2="apictl46"
env_46ga="apictl46"

# QA and Production environments
env_uat="apictl45"

# You can add more environments as needed
# env_staging="apictl46"
# env_next="apictl45"

# List of all configured environments (space-separated)
ALL_ENVIRONMENTS="dev snapshot rc2 uat 46ga"
